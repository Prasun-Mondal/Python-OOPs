        "Q1>\tWhat is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects and data, rather than functions and logic. It focuses on the creation of reusable and modular components, allowing for inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation to structure and manage code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2> What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> A class is a blueprint for creating objects in OOP. It defines a set of attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have. A class encapsulates data and functions that operate on that data, allowing for the creation of instances (objects).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3> What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity created from the class blueprint and has its own properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Objects represent actual things in the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4> What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> **Abstraction** is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows focusing on what an object does, rather than how it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation** is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit or class. It also involves restricting access to some of the object's components to prevent unintended interference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5> What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> Dunder methods (or magic methods) are special methods in Python that are surrounded by double underscores, such as `__init__, __str__, __repr__,` and `__add__`. These methods allow you to customize the behavior of objects in certain operations, like initialization, string representation, or arithmetic operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6> Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a class (child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent class). It allows for code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7> What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> Polymorphism is the ability to use a single interface or method name for different types of objects. This means that different classes can have methods with the same name but behave differently based on the object calling the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8> How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> Encapsulation in Python is achieved through the use of classes and by controlling access to class attributes and methods. Python uses access specifiers like private (_variable), protected (__variable), and public (variable) to restrict or allow access to the attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9> What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> A constructor in Python is a special method `__init__()` used to initialize newly created objects. It is called automatically when a new object of a class is created and is used to set the initial state of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10> What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> **Class method** is a method that is bound to the class rather than the instance of the class. It is defined with @classmethod decorator and takes cls as the first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Static method** is a method that does not take self or cls as the first argument. It is defined with @staticmethod and is independent of the class and instance. It can be called on the class or an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11> What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but with different argument types or numbers. Python does not support method overloading directly, but you can simulate it by using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12> What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows the subclass to modify or extend the functionality of the parent class method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13> What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> The `@property` decorator in Python is used to define a method as a property, allowing you to access it like an attribute. This is useful for creating read-only attributes or controlling access to an attribute while hiding implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14> Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> Polymorphism allows for more flexible and reusable code by enabling objects of different types to be treated as if they are of the same type. It helps in creating systems that can handle a variety of objects and behaviors in a uniform way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15> What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It can contain abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses. Abstract classes are defined using the ABC module and `@abstractmethod` decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16> What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> **Modularity**: Code is organized into reusable classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reusability**: Inheritance allows for reusing existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Maintainability**: Code is easier to modify and maintain due to encapsulation and modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scalability**: Systems can grow in a more manageable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Flexibility**: Polymorphism allows different objects to be treated uniformly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17> What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> **Class variable** is shared by all instances of the class. It is defined within the class but outside any methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Instance variable** is unique to each instance of the class. It is usually defined within methods and is tied to specific objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18> What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> Multiple inheritance in Python occurs when a class is derived from more than one base class. Python supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19> Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> `__str__`: It is used to define a user-friendly string representation of an object. It is meant for display to the end user.\n",
        "\n",
        "`__repr__`: It is used to define an official string representation of an object. It is meant for debugging and logging and should ideally return a string that could be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20> What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> The `super()` function is used to call a method from a parent class. It allows a subclass to invoke the method of its parent, ensuring proper method resolution in cases of inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21> What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> The `__del__` method is a destructor method in Python, which is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used for cleanup purposes, such as releasing resources or closing connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22> What is the difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> `@staticmethod`: A method that does not take a reference to the instance (`self`) or the class (`cls`). It can be called on both the class and an instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "`@classmethod`: A method that takes a reference to the class (`cls`) as the first argument. It can modify class state and is bound to the class, not instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23> How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> In Python, polymorphism with inheritance allows a subclass to define a method with the same name as in the parent class, but with a different implementation. This enables different behaviors based on the object type, even when using the same method name.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24> What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> Method chaining refers to the technique of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line. It is typically used when methods return the object itself (i.e., `self`), allowing you to chain method calls together.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25> What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans> The`__call__` method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When an object is called as if it were a function, Python will invoke the `__call__` method. This is useful for implementing objects that need to behave like functions."
